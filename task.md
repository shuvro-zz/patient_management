Our patient management system is simple:

When users visit the contact page, they will be able to submit a patient to contact us.

Once they've created a patient, the system will send us an email to let us know that there is a new patient.

The patient system automatically generates a unique link to let us access the patient.

We can view all the patients.

We can be able to reply, edit, change patients' status or delete them.
